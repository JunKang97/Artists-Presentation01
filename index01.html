        Artist: Harm Van Den Dorpel
    </h2>
    <p>
        Born 1981 in Zaadam, Netherland, he is a Berlin based conceptual Artist
        <br>
        His board practice includes the creation of sculpture, collage, computer animation, computer generated graphics and interaction design.
        <br>
        In his work, he investigates how algorithms can analyse digital archives and guide the artist in aesthetic decision taking, leading to a sumbiosis of man-machine art creation.

        <h3>Work Description</h3>
        <p>
            This project is part of an ongoing project, currently developing with
            the help of an artificial intelligence software designed by the artist.
            Beginning with a single, original pair of images–a nongendered "Adam & Eve"–the system "breeds"
            images togeteher iteratively to create possible new compositions.
            <br>
            The breeding process, watched over and tweaked by the artist according
            to his own aesthetic preferences, has birthed hundreds of images so far.
            He himself assumes the role of a breeder, intervening in the algorithm to 
            choose which of the images should mate with each other, creating families and
            generations of related images.
            <br>
            When he is satisfied with a result, he can "freeze" the image.
