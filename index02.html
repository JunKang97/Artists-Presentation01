        <h3>Work Description</h3>
        <p>
            Rendered in a Google Maps-esque style, this interactive 
            website provides areial views of the world, fragmented and
            collaged into a dense panorma that toys with one's perspective
            <br>
            As you drag your cursor around, geographic boundaries collapse;
            images of deserts, beaches, forests, fence, etc.
            <br>
            Travel infrastructure, border control and flight avaliability 
            play a role in regulating the flow of people and their experience
            of the world just like the infrastructure and localized policing
            of the internet controls the flow of data, communication and the user's experience
            of the world.
            <br>
            Joe made the effort to make the site mobile-friendly, placing the world's 
            terrains literally in the palm of yout hands; exactly how we navigate our surroundings today.
